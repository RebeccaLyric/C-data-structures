1. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 40 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out at capacity 8, assuming that the array will double in capacity each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic array? As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the average big-oh complexity for a push?

Initial capacity 8:
Pushes 1 through 8    = 8 units

New capacity 16:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 8 units moved
Pushes 9 through 16   = 8 units

New capacity 32:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 16 units moved
Pushes 17 through 32  = 16 units

New capacity 64:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 32 units moved
Pushes 33 through 40  = 8 units

*** 96 total units / 40 pushes = 2.4 average units per push ***

2. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 40 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out at capacity 8, assuming that the array will grow by a constant 2 spaces each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic array? As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the average big-oh complexity for a push?

Initial capacity 8:
Pushes 1 through 8    = 8 units

New capacity 10:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 8 units moved
Pushes 9 and 10       = 2 units

New capacity 12:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 10 units moved
Pushes 11 and 12      = 2 units

New capacity 14:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 12 units moved
Pushes 13 and 14      = 2 units

New capacity 16:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 14 units moved
Pushes 15 and 16      = 2 units

New capacity 18:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 16 units moved
Pushes 17 and 18      = 2 units

New capacity 20:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 18 units moved
Pushes 19 and 20      = 2 units

New capacity 22:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 20 units moved
Pushes 21 and 22      = 2 units

New capacity 24:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 22 units moved
Pushes 23 and 24      = 2 units

New capacity 26:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 24 units moved
Pushes 25 and 26      = 2 units

New capacity 28:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 26 units moved
Pushes 27 and 28      = 2 units

New capacity 30:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 28 units moved
Pushes 29 and 30      = 2 units

New capacity 32:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 30 units moved
Pushes 31 and 32      = 2 units

New capacity 34:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 32 units moved
Pushes 33 and 34      = 2 units

New capacity 36:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 34 units moved
Pushes 35 and 36      = 2 units

New capacity 38:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 36 units moved
Pushes 37 and 38      = 2 units

New capacity 40:
Cost of resize = O(n) = 38 units moved
Pushes 39 and 40      = 2 units

*** 408 total units / 40 pushes = 10.2 average units per push ***
